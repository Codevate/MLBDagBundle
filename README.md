This Symfony2 bundle allows to developers to manage Directed Acyclic Graphs by using both an adjacency list, and a full transitive closure for indirect edges.

At present only a Doctrine implementation is provided. Support for more ORMs, and ODMs might be added later.

This bundle also implements a complete integration test suite for the entity classes.
